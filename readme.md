# Gated LLM

## Description
This repository contains four Colab notebooks that provide various functionalities for working with text data. Each notebook focuses on a specific task, as outlined below:

1. `convert_anything_to_text.ipynb`: This notebook enables the transcription of videos and extraction of text from PDFs and other types of documents. It provides a versatile solution for converting various data formats into raw text.

2. `falcon_on_custom_pdf.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the utilization of LangChain to ingest custom PDFs as context for the Falcon 7b LLM (Language Model).

3. `finetune_chatgpt.ipynb`: This notebook facilitates fine-tuning of OpenAI's ChatGPT models using custom datasets or CSV files. It emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning a model on specific data rather than solely relying on passing custom data as context.

4. `falcon_transfer_learning.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on training the Falcon model using Bits and Bytes, Qlora, and PEFT (Promoting Effective Fine-tuning) on custom CSV data, employing transfer learning. It highlights the significance of transfer learning compared to fine-tuning.

## When to Use Fine-tuning vs. Transfer Learning

### Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is a technique used to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain by training it further on a custom dataset. It is recommended to use fine-tuning in the following scenarios:

1. **Task-specific Data**: When you have a limited amount of data that is relevant to your specific task, fine-tuning allows you to leverage the pre-trained model's knowledge and adapt it to your domain.

2. **Narrower Focus**: Fine-tuning is useful when you need the model to be highly specialized for a particular task. By fine-tuning, you can refine the model's parameters to improve performance in a specific context.

3. **Transfer Learning Insufficiency**: If the pre-trained model's performance is not satisfactory for your task out-of-the-box, fine-tuning offers an opportunity to enhance its capabilities by incorporating task-specific information.

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning involves utilizing knowledge gained from training a model on one task or dataset and applying it to a different but related task or dataset. It is beneficial under the following circumstances:

1. **Limited Data**: When you have a small dataset for your target task, transfer learning allows you to leverage the knowledge acquired from a large dataset used in pre-training, thereby mitigating the data scarcity issue.

2. **Similar Domains**: If the source and target tasks share similar characteristics or domains, transfer learning can be advantageous. The pre-trained model's understanding of common patterns and features can be effectively utilized.

3. **Computationally Efficient**: Transfer learning can save significant computational resources compared to training a model from scratch. By starting with a pre-trained model, you can expedite the training process and achieve good results faster.

Note: Both fine-tuning and transfer learning are powerful techniques; however, the choice between them depends on the availability of data, task specificity, and the extent of overlap between the source and target domains.
